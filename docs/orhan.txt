Initially I had the following code:
 
[samples, stats, structArray] = matbugs(dataStruct,
   fullfile(pwd, 'E:\Mehmet\Work\MCMC\models\model1.txt'), .......
 
I was able to avoid the error when I added the following line to shorten the 'pwd' length: 
 
cd ('E:\Mehmet\Work\MCMC\models'); %changes the 'pwd' to this directory%
 
Then the part of the code that calls MATBUGS becomes:
 
[samples, stats, structArray] = matbugs(dataStruct, fullfile(pwd, 'model1.txt'), ........
 
which resulted in a problem free execution of WINBUGS through MATBUGS
for me.
